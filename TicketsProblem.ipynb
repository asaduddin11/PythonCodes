        "#The Question:\n",
        "  The new \"Avengers\" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. An \"Avengers\" ticket costs 25 dollars.\n",
        "  Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.\n",
        "  Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?\n",
        "  Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.\n",
        "    \n",
